# Practice

## Description

This repository contains some simple scripts I made just to improve my programming skills. Also there are solutions for common interview questions.

## Scripts

### 1. [calculate_Pi.py](./scripts/calculate_Pi.py)

This script contains three functions to calculate Pi. Scripts measures time evaluated to calculate n numbers of Pi using different functions. I used three formulas:

1. Bellard's formula:

![bellard](./src/bellard.svg)

2. Bailey-Borwein-Plouff formula:

![bbp](./src/bbp.svg)

3. Chudnovsky formula:

![chudnovsky](./src/chudnovsky.svg)

### 2. [crypto_numbers.py](./scripts/crypto_numbers.py)

This script contains useful functions I used for my cryptography related projects such as generating random prime numbers, factorization of numbers etc.

### 3. [integral_calculator.py](./scripts/integral_calculator.py)

This script contains three functions to calculate integrals:

1. [Rectangle method](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmXoypizjW3WknFiJnKLwHCnL72vedxjQkDDP1mXWo6uco/wiki/Rectangle_method.html)

2. [Trapezoidal method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trapezoidal_rule)

3. [Simpson's method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simpson%27s_rule)

### 4. [Calculator](./scripts/Calculator)

Every beginner programmer must write its own calculator, so here is mine.

### 5. [max_subarray.py](./scripts/max_subarray.py)

This script contains one function that implements searching of the subbarray with highest sum of elements.
Example:

    array: 1 2 3 -9 9 1 -2
    
    max_subarray: 9 1

### 6. [sort.py](./scripts/sort.py)

This script contains different sorting algorithm implementations.


### 7. [fibonacci.py](./scripts/fibonacci.py)

This script contains two functions to calculate n-th number of Fibonacci sequence - slow and fast realisations. Also there is a function to calculate Pisano period and a function for fast calculation of Fn mod m.
