# Practice

## Description

This repository contains little scripts I made to improve my programming skills. Also, there are some scripts I used in other my projects and I find them useful.

## Scripts

### 1. [calculate_Pi.py](./scripts/calculate_Pi.py)

This script contains three functions to calculate Pi. Scripts measures time evaluated to calculate n numbers of Pi using different functions. I used three formulas:

1. Bellard's formula:

2. Bailey-Borwein-Plouff formula:

3. Chudnovsky formula:

### 2. [crypto_numbers.py](./scripts/crypto_numbers.py)

This script contains useful functions I used for my cryptography related projects such as generating random prime numbers, factorization of numbers etc.
